ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives (SMART Questions):
Which countries had the highest and lowest digital payment usage rates in 2021?

What is the global average for mobile money account adoption among adults aged 15+ in 2021?

How does digital payment usage compare to mobile money account adoption across income groups?

Which regions or countries showed above-average account ownership in 2021?

What percentage of adults in low-income vs high-income countries made digital payments in 2021?


ðŸ“Š Key Insights:
Global Account Ownership:

In 2021, global account ownership rates varied widely by country.

High-income countries generally showed near-total account ownership, while many low-income countries had much lower rates.

Countries like Denmark, Finland, and others led in account ownership, with rates close to 100%.

Digital Payments Usage:

Digital payment usage was highest in advanced economies with widespread financial infrastructure.

Countries such as Denmark had nearly universal usage of digital payments, while many developing nations still lagged.

There is a clear digital divide between high-income and low-income regions.

Mobile Money Adoption:

Mobile money adoption was particularly strong in some African countries, showing its role as a financial inclusion tool where traditional banking access is limited.

Uganda, for instance, ranked among the top in mobile money account adoption despite lower traditional banking rates.

Mobile money continues to fill gaps in regions without widespread bank access.

Overall Trends:

Digital financial services (digital payments and mobile money) are growing, but gaps remain based on income, region, and infrastructure.

The data highlights how different economies adopt different financial technologies based on need and access.
